blowfish_very_first_py_realization.py - main blowfish encryption algorithm.
It has its own interface. Also, there is CubeHash algorithm as well.

blowfish_vectors.txt - correctly ciphered vectors. Used to check whether 
algorithm encrypts properly.

test_blowfish.py - file with unittests. Proves that algorithm works propertly.

blowtest.txt - random text that is able to be either encrypted or decrypted by yourself.
